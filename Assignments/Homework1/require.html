                <h2>Requirement Analysis</h2><br/>
                <p>In systems building and programming planning, essentials examination joins those endeavors that go into choosing the conditions for another or balanced thing or adventure, surveying the maybe conflicting necessities of the diverse accomplices, exploring, detailing, affirming and supervising programming or structure necessities.</p>
                <h2>Design</h2><br/>
                <p>Design is the process in which the engineer determines the purpose and goals of the program. In this process the engineer sets up the components he or she will need in their program. “Software design may refer to either ‘all the activity involved in conceptualizing, framing, implementing, commissioning, and ultimately modifying complex systems’ or ‘the activity following requirements specification and before programming, as ... [in] a stylized software engineering process.’” Especially, design is like drawing a blueprint of your program.</p>
