                <h2>Implementation</h2><br/>
                <p>The implementation and coding phase of the software development life cycle is the third phase of the SDLC process. The primary period of the SDLC is the prerequisites social occasion and investigation stage, which is the point at which the venture group and business administrators assemble the needs and needs of the client.</p>

                <h2>Testing</h2><br/>
                <p>Software testing is an examination directed to furnish partners with data about the nature of the product item or administration under test. Programming testing can likewise give a target, autonomous perspective of the product to enable the business to acknowledge and comprehend the dangers of programming execution. Test procedures incorporate the way toward executing a program or application with the goal of discovering programming bugs (blunders or different deformities), and checking that the product item is fit for use.</p><br/>
                <p>As the quantity of conceivable tests for even basic programming parts is for all intents and purposes endless, all product testing utilizes some procedure to choose tests that are possible for the accessible time and assets. Accordingly, programming testing ordinarily (however not solely) endeavors to execute a program or application with the goal of discovering programming bugs (blunders or different imperfections). The activity of testing is an iterative procedure as when one bug is settled, it can light up other, more profound bugs, or can even make new ones.</p>
